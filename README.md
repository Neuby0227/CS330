# CS330

New design skills that I have learned and implemented in this project are OpenGL tools including shapes, textures and lighting. These skills were used to combine multiple shapes including spheres, planes, torus', and other shapes together to create game objects. I will be able to use these skills in future projects to help create 3D objects when they are needed.

I approached this project with the mindset of doing a little bit at a time and running it whenever changes were made. Doing this will limit the amount of code that could potentially could be causing issues. Utilizing this tactic in future projects will also minimize the time spent searching for errors.

Computer Science can help me in reaching my goals as I am trying to get in the video game industry as a backend developer. Computational graphics and visualization can help with my educational and professional pathways for this as I will need to have an understanding of these to apply different physics within the game world. Examples of this could be objects ricocheting off a player or an object exploding upon impact with another object.
